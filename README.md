# InstanceTask
An instance task app is a software application that allows users to create and manage tasks or to-do items within the app. These tasks can be organized by category or project and may include features such as setting reminders, adding notes or attachments, and tracking progress. Some instance task apps may also allow for collaboration with other users, allowing multiple people to work together on a task or project. They can be used by individuals to manage personal tasks, or by teams in organizations to manage workflow and collaboration.
